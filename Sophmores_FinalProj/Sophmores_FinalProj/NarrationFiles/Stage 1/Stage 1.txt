"Alright, so there are three doors ahead of you.  Each door will lead to a different part of the cavern.  Each cavern has a unique layout and is filled with various enemies.   There may be a few puzzles you have to solve.  At the end you will receive a key.  After receiving all three keys you will be able to unlock the big door over there,"  Odalf explains as you listen.

"Here is a satchel.  You are going to need it in case there is anything you need to collect or would like to hold.  There is also a notepad in case you want to note anything along the way.  Are you ready to go?" Odalf asks.

"Unfortunately, I won't be able to go with you.  Good luck my friend."

 <prompt yes or no> (regardless too bad go) <choose door>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You close the door behind you.  You look around you.  There are torches on the wall the light the path ahead of you.  There is an eerie silence in the cave and suddenly anxiety runs over you and you decide that you don't want to do this anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You turn back to open the door but you find it locked.  �I guess there is only one way to go now.

You make your way down the caverns path.  To your left you see an iron door.  You try the handle but it seems to be locked from the other side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You reluctantly make your way on down the path.  You slow your pace when you see something on the ground ahead of you. �What is that?�, you whisper to yourself.  As you near, you realize that something read is coating the ground.  You take a close look and conclude it is blood.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You jump back a few steps.  �That�s a lot of blood,� you say again to yourself.  You also notice a quiver of arrows lying on the ground.  You pick up the quiver and counts the arrows.  There are 50 of them.  �I�ll need a bow for these.   There�s no harm in holding on to them though,� you contemplate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<ask user if they want to add arrows to inventory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suddenly, you hear a noise coming from somewhere.   Ahead of you there is a bend in the cavern and you hear the noise again come from around the corner.

You look at the ground and see that the blood trail leads around the corner.  �Hello!�, you let out.  No response.

You slowly approach the bend.  You wait for several moments before you muster up the courage to peer around the bend.    Ahead of you is a skeleton with an iron sword.  It turns quickly at the noise that you have made.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<combat> <add inventory>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You look over the fallen skeleton.  Your first enemy kill.  �That kind of felt good.  I might be cut out for this.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you take a moment to catch your breath you notice the blood trail once again.  It ends abruptly a few feet away form you.  "How does it just stop?", you ask yourself.  Just then your eyes catch something on the wall.

Written in blood is the word KERDASH. "K-E-R-D-A-S-H?", you spell out.  What does that even mean, you think to yourself.  Well Odalf did say I might want to note things.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<prompt user if they want to take a note> <note added KERDASH>



 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You decide to make your way on.  Ahead of you there is a large amount of light.  You decide to go on closer to inspect the source.  As you near, you realize that it�s a campfire.  How did this get here?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 You look around and see no one in sight.  You look down to find a torn piece of journal paper.  You pick it up to inspect.

 <"To whom it may concern.  I have become very cautious of him.">

 You look for more of the paper but there doesn't seem to be any.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<prompt to ask to add to inventory>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Just then you think you hear something.  Before you have time to react, the ugliest green create you have ever seen before appears in front of you.

 "Gargh abash glar rah tuu!" yells the creature.  It's a goblin!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 <combat> add to inventory>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 The battle is over and you have defeated your second enemy.   You lay down to catch your breath.   Never in a million years would you have thought you would have been on such a treasure hunt as this one.  �There better be a lot of treasure in this for me,� you let out as you get up and make your way on down the cavern tunnel.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Soon you find yourself at a smooth, stonewall.  Chiseled in the wall at the top is some sort of riddle.  �One word that doesn�t have any letters repeating.  � �What?�, you let out as you scratch your head.    You notice that the wall has an alphabet.  It appears that each letter has its own pushable piece.  You decide to try goblin.  You push in the letters �G-O-B-L-I-N�.  You wait a second only to find the letters to retract back to their original slots.  That�s not it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <prompt to ask what to guess> <maybe prompt to see inventory>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<if KERDASH> (letters stay pushed in and the smooth stone wall raised into the ceiling reveling the other side) The stonewall suddenly rises into the ceiling, revealing the other side.  The first thing you notice is that the revealed new room has light shining in from the ceiling.  You take a look around room.  There are several pillars in the middle that circle around what appears to be a statue sitting on a throne.  The statue has to be at least 12 feet tall.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You look around the room and notice an iron door.  You try the handle but find it locked.  When you turn around you see something in the middle of the room that was blocked from your line of sight because of the pillars.

A chest!  You run over to the chest to inspect it.  You try opening it to find, that it too, is locked.  �Why is everything locked in here.� you let out in dismay.  Out of the corner of your eye you see a shimmer.

Around the statues neck is a silver key.  Perfect!  You go over to the statue to figure out how you are going to get the key.  Despite being a 12 foot tall statue sitting down, the seat of the chair in relatively low.  You are able to hoist yourself up onto the seat of the chair.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next, you make your way up onto the arm of the chair and walk towards the shoulder of the statue.  Now the key is almost in reach.  You reach your hand out but you are just unable to grasp the key.  You place one hand of the shoulder of the statue to get a better grip and reach out again.

This time you are able to get the key.  The only problem is the key is still on the chain around the statues neck.  You pull a few times to see if they chain will give.  Suddenly, you feel the statue shift.  All of a sudden, there is green goo dripping from somewhere above you onto the top of your head.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You slowly wipe the green goo from face off and look up.  Your gaze meets two dark brown eyes.  It's not a statue! It's a giant!  As the giant gets up from the throne you fall back and crash to the floor with a thud.  The giant lets out a giant yell and swings a giant club towards you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You roll out of the way just in time to gather yourself.
<combat>
<add whatever>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You look over the fallen body of the giant.  You take the key and head over to the iron door.  It opens and you find yourself in a tunnel.  You make your way in the darkness until you find yourself back at another iron door.  You open it and find yourself at the beginning of the stage.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So that's where that lead."
