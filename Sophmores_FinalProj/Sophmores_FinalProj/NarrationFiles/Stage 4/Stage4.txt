\”Alright, the final door. But this time, I’m going with you.\”, Odalf says as he follows you into the last door. You walk together in silence down a dark path for what seems likes a few minutes. Alas, there is light ahead of you and you can see that the tunnel opens up. When you get to the opening you are surprised by what you see.All around you is lava! The ceiling of the cavern is several hundred feet. \”This place is massive!\”, you exclaim. Straight ahead of you is a narrow path that leads up to a platform about fifty feet into the air. The path leading up is steep and rocky. \”Follow me and watch your step.\”, Odalf lets out as he leads the way.You follow Odalf up the narrow path. The air is incredibly hot and sticky. He leads the way through a rocky path. As you look over the edge you can see the drop down below into the churning lava. At every couple steps that you take you send rocks over the edge into the burning abyss. As you make your ascent you can see the room more clearly from this height. Lava stretches several hundred yards in each direction that you look. \”Not too far now.\”, Odalf says over his shoulder.It’s not soon before you reach the top. You hoist yourself up onto the platform and you can’t believe what your eyes see in front of you. In front of you is a massive chest with gold and diamonds bursting out of it. \”You weren’t lying! How much is this.\”, you let out.\”More than you or I could count or ever need.\”, Odalf responds. \”But first, there is another matter we have to deal with.\”, he lets out passively. Just then you hear a loud screech that echoes the cavern walls. It’s so loud you drop to one knee and have to cover your ears. Rocks from the ceiling fall as the screech echoes on.The sound disorients you but you are able to gather your self in time to see your worst nightmare. Above you hovers the dragon. With a wingspan of about 80 feet, he glides around the platform. He lets out another screech and lets out a breath of fire.He lands on the other side of the platform and stares on back at you. You notice something that he is standing over and realize that it is a body. It has the resemblance of Odalf.\”This is it. You’re going to have to do this alone.\”, Odalf tells you. The dragon lets out another screech and comes flying at you.<combat>The battle is over. \”I can’t believe I did it!.\”, you let out. You look at the fallen dragon in front of you in disbelief. You did that. You walk over to the treasure and take a fistful of gold and diamonds. \”It’s all ours!.\”, you let out in joy. \”Actually, it’s all mine.\”, you hear a voice from behind you.You turn around to see someone staring back at you. \”Wait, Odalf is that you?\”, you ask the person. \”Yes, it is I.\”, Odalf lets out. He looks completely different as a human. He’s lost his blue glow and his icy blue eyes have turned a soft gray. You also look down to see his two feet touching the ground.\”What do you mean it’s yours?\”, you ask Odalf. \”You see, there have been people here before. I lied to you. You’re actually the fourth person I’ve had to come find.\”, Odalf explain. \”There’s been someone that’s made it to each stage, but no one has made it as far as you.\”\”All you have been good for is getting me here. Now it is time for you to die.\”, Odalf lets out sinisterly.<combat>You look over Odalfs fallen body. You drop to two knees. Was this all worth it, you think to yourself. You stand up and walk over to the treasure. The gleam of the gold and diamonds tempt you but you close the chest lid shut. You walk on down the rocky path empty handed. It’s time to go home.
