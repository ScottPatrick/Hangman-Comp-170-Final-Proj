You greet Odalf with a grin. \”I can see you have done successfully.\”, Odalf responds excitingly. \”Hard but manageable.\”, you respond triumphantly. \”I just hope that the next tunnel isn’t as wet.\”, you say as you squeeze the water out of your clothes.Wet and cold you travel onwards into the third door. As travel inwards, you see another iron barred door. \”Must lead to the end.\”, you let out. You make your way onwards.The air suddenly gets colder and you notice something white that is coating the ground ahead of you. As you get closer you realize that it is snow. \”Snow?\”, you let out. \”Is this even possible?\”, you say in disbelief. For as far as you can see ahead of you, snow coats the ground and walls.You notice something ahead of you in the snow. You approach cautiously. As you get closer you realize that it is a person. You take out your sword slowly and approach the figure. You poke them the figure and nothing happens. The object is curled up in a ball. You carefully shift the corpse and notice that it’s missing have it’s face. \”What happened to you?\”, you let out. It’s flesh is hanging out and it the sight makes you jump. There is a horrified gaze that you cannot get out of your memory. You pull the corpses hood over its face to spare you from seeing anymore.You notice something in the corpses hand. You gently pry open it’s hand and find a hand written note. \”He’s not who he says he is. Be careful.\”, the note says. Who is he? You sit there and ponder but nothing comes to mind.<add note to inventory>Movement out of the corner of your eyes suddenly disrupts your thoughts. You look around but seeing nothing. You look around you and see footprints everywhere. You hadn’t noticed them before. You kneel down to take a closer look. It’s from sort of animal.Just then a creature hiding in the snow lunges out at you. You dive to the side and land in a snow bank. You quickly gather yourself in time to see lunged out at you. A giant white wolf is snarling at you.<combat>You make your way on after defeating the wolf. You can see that ahead of you the snow ends. The air is much warmer and you begin to stop shivering. You suddenly notice how quick this new part of the cavern is. You look around and the lighting seems to dim ahead of you.As you make your ways forwards you have to squint your eyes to see. Suddenly, you hear something in the shadows around you. You look around you to find the source of the sound. Again you hear the sound.\”Mmmmm.\”, comes from the darkness. You anxiously look around to find what company is with you in the darkness. \”Mmmmmmmm.\”, comes from the darkness, much louder this time. Suddenly, a green figure is in front of you. A zombie!<combat>After fighting off the zombie you find yourself alone in the darkness. You’re confused as to where to go next. In the fight you lost what direction you where headed in and there is no way of telling which way is forward and which way is the direction you just came from.You hear a rattling from the darkness and you decide to follow where it leads. As you draw closer to the sound you are able to pinpoint where it come from. Dangling from a nook on the cavern wall is a rusty key on a silver chain. Every time the key sways it makes a clinking noise against the cavern rock wall. \”Must have been where the noise was coming from.\”This looks like it might be useful, but you have no idea of its use. You should probably take it anyways.<prompt to add to inventory>Ahead of you there is a small gleam of light. As you approach the source you realize that it is a door. You cautiously open it and light blinds your eyes. You walk into a new room and see a locked door ahead of you. You also notice something written on the floor. Carved with a rock is written, \”There is no help for you. He has tricked us all.\”. Who do they keep referring to, you wonder. You look around to see what else is in the room. In the corner is another skeletal remain. You go to the door in front of you. You find it to be locked when you try the handle.<prompt to try the key you found>The door opens and you slowly make your way into another room. The place smells of rotten meat. You see another chest in the room as well.\”WHO COMES THERE!\”, yells out a voice that makes you jump. Suddenly an orc appears right in front of you.<Prompt1. My name is (player name) and I’m looking for a key.2. Me! And I’m here to slay you, monster!>\”Many have come before you, but you will not get past me!\”, yells the orc.<enter combat>You look over the fallen orc and notice a golden key around his neck. You break it off his chain and add it to your satchel.<add gold key to inventory>You walk over to the chest and open with the gold key.<add whatever to inventory>You spot a gate in the back of the room. You open it and go through the tunnel that leads back to the beginning by the door.As you make your way back to the start you start pondering in your head, what do these clues keep referring too? Who is he?You open the door and find Odalf, who is exceptionally happy to see you. \”Congratulations, you’ve made it!\”, yells Odalf. \”How was it?\”, he asks.“Well, I wasn’t going to mention it earlier. But, I keep finding these notes along the way referring to someone that I can’t trust. I also keep finding dead bodies. Did you know there were people here before me?\”, you ask.\”I have no idea what that can be referring to. And as far as I know, no one has been in these caverns but myself.\”, Odalf lets out. There is a brief silence and Odalf lets out, \”Lets get on to the last door.\”.
