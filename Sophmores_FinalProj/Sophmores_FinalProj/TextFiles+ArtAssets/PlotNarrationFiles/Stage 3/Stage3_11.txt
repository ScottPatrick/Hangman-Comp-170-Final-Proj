You hear a rattling from the darkness and you decide to follow where it leads. 
As you draw closer to the sound you are able to pinpoint where it come from. 
Dangling from a nook on the cavern wall is a rusty key on a silver chain. 
Every time the key sways it makes a clinking noise against the 
cavern rock wall. ”Must have been where the noise was coming from.”
