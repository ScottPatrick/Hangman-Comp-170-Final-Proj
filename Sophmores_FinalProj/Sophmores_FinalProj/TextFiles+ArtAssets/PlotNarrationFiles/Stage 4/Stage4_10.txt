The battle is over. ”I can’t believe I did it!.” you let out. 
You look at the fallen dragon in front of you in disbelief. You did that. 
You walk over to the treasure and take a fistful of gold and diamonds. 
”It’s all ours!.” you let out in joy. ”Actually, it’s all mine.” 
you hear a voice from behind you.
