All around you is lava! The ceiling of the cavern is several hundred feet. 
”This place is massive!” you exclaim. Straight ahead of you is a narrow 
path that leads up to a platform about fifty feet into the air. 
The path leading up is steep and rocky. ”Follow me and watch your step.” 
Odalf lets out as he leads the way.
