You turn around to see someone staring back at you. ”Wait, Odalf is that you?”
you ask the person. ”Yes, it is I.”, Odalf lets out. 
He looks completely different as a human. He’s lost his blue glow and his 
icy blue eyes have turned a soft gray. You also look down to see his 
two feet touching the ground.
