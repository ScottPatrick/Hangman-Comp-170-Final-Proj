You look over Odalfs fallen body. You drop to two knees. Was this all worth it, 
you think to yourself. 
You stand up and walk over to the treasure. The gleam of the gold and diamonds 
tempt you but you close the chest lid shut. 



You walk on down the rocky path empty handed. 



It’s time to go home.
